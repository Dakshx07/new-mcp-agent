# StreamHub Architecture

## System Overview

StreamHub is built on a microservices architecture with the following main components:

### Frontend Layer
- Next.js application serving the user interface
- WebRTC for low-latency streaming
- Socket.io for real-time features

### Backend Services
1. **API Gateway**
   - Route management
   - Authentication
   - Rate limiting

2. **User Service**
   - User management
   - Authentication
   - Profiles

3. **Stream Service**
   - Stream management
   - RTMP handling
   - Transcoding

4. **Chat Service**
   - Real-time messaging
   - Message history
   - Moderation

5. **Analytics Service**
   - Viewer metrics
   - Performance monitoring
   - Business analytics

### Data Layer
- PostgreSQL for user data
- MongoDB for chat and analytics
- Redis for caching and real-time features

### Infrastructure
- AWS for cloud hosting
- CloudFront for CDN
- S3 for media storage

## Data Flow

1. **Live Streaming**
```
Streamer -> RTMP Server -> Transcoder -> Edge Servers -> Viewers
```

2. **Chat Messages**
```
User -> WebSocket -> Chat Service -> Redis PubSub -> Connected Clients
```

3. **VOD Playback**
```
S3 -> CloudFront -> Edge Location -> Viewer
```

## Security Considerations

- JWT for authentication
- HTTPS everywhere
- WebSocket security
- Media encryption
- DDoS protection

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Multiple RTMP edges
- Load-balanced API servers
- Distributed cache

### Vertical Scaling
- Optimized database queries
- Efficient media processing
- Smart caching strategies
